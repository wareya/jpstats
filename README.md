# Japanese Text Stats Tools

Command line program containing several different analysis tools for analyzing long Japanese stories and comparing them to one another. Counts, frequency analysis, complexity estimation, etc.

All necessary functionality is present but there's no good interface (even command-line) yet.

# Existing Analyses

This repository already contains analysis results for visual novels (workspace/), stories from 小説家になろう (narou/), and a pile of plaintext novels I found lying around somewhere (novels/) (grouped by author, not series). This includes stats and merged frequency lists. The collections of individual frequency lists are quite large so I have no plans to share them through the repository, but if you ask me somewhere I can archive and upload them for you.

No quality guarantees of any kind are made regarding the analysis methods used here (I'm just a hobbyist) nor are any guarantees made about the cleanness of the corpus material on which the analyses were run.
